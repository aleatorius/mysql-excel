* pip install -r requirements.txt  (do it preferably in venv env)

* [sql_to_folders_and_excel.py](sql_to_folders_and_excel.py) -- this script reads from the CALST database (the path and the password is specified in the [server.md](server.md) where a password should be inserted) and interprets this database as the list of folders with excel files like wrapper.xlsx and exercise.xlsx, following lesson structures
* NB: do not push server.md with your pass to the git repo, I use server_private.md which is ignored in .gitignore)
